# How to Play

You can follow the build instructions in 'To Build This Project' below to play this game if you are able to download this repo and already have (or are willing to download and install) node/npm. Otherwise, I recommend loading it up using your preferred online development environment. Example, Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/Destro168/LootQuest3

Troubleshooting Note: If Stackblitz loads but doesn't run the project successfully it may be because of your browser. As of 7/5/2022, webcontainers in Firefox are considered experimental and displayed as such in the Stackblitz online IDE. The recommended fix is to either use a different browser like chrome (tested working) or a different online development environment with easy git imports like CodeSandbox (tested working).

Alternatively, if Stackblitz displays any prompts that could possibly the resolve your issue, the recommendation is to follow them, or try another browser or online ide if those prompts fail to resolve one's issues.
